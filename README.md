he code begins by importing the necessary libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. It then reads the CSV file and ensures that the columns Population_Males and Population_Females are converted to numeric values, handling any non-numeric entries by coercing them to NaN. Rows with missing values in these two columns are dropped to ensure data cleanliness. A scatter plot is created using Seaborn, plotting the male population on the x-axis and the female population on the y-axis. This visualization helps identify any patterns or correlations between male and female population distributions. The plot is styled with appropriate axis labels and a title for clarity, making it a useful tool for demographic analysis within the dataset.
